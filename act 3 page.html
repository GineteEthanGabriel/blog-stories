  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Ever since I started taking IT-related subjects, I often ask myself one question,
      <em>“Ano ba gagawin ko after ng graduation?”</em>
      Being an IT student made me realize that technology is not just about coding or fixing computers.
      It’s a field full of opportunities, and my experiences in school slowly helped me understand what kind of career I want to pursue in the future.
    </p>

  <h2>The IT Career I See Myself In</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      In the next few years, I see myself working in the tech industry as a software-related professional.
      I may not be fully sure yet about a specific job title, but I know I want to be involved in creating,
      improving, or maintaining systems that people actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      What excites me about an IT career is that learning never stops.
      New tools, new programming languages, and new challenges always come up, and that motivates me to keep improving myself.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Skills I Know I Need to Improve</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Being honest with myself, I know that having a degree is not enough.
      Skills matter a lot in the IT field. Right now, I am still developing my technical and personal skills.
      There are times when coding feels difficult and overwhelming, but I remind myself that learning takes time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>Some skills I want to continuously work on are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming and problem-solving skills</li>
    <li>Time management and discipline</li>
    <li>Communication and teamwork</li>
    <li>Adaptability to new technologies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Think Companies Look For</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Based on what I observe and hear, companies don’t just look for someone who is good at coding.
      They also value attitude, willingness to learn, and the ability to work well with others.
      As an entry-level IT graduate in the future, I believe showing effort, curiosity, and responsibility
      will be just as important as technical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why I try to take my school projects seriously, even when they feel challenging or stressful.
      I see them as practice for the real working environment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Thinking about my career and future goals helps me stay focused as a student.
      My journey in IT is still ongoing, and I know I still have a lot to learn.
      My biggest takeaway is that success in this field requires patience, consistency, and effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving forward, my goal is to continue improving my skills, gain confidence, and prepare myself for real-world challenges.
      I may not have everything figured out yet, but I am willing to grow, learn, and work hard to achieve the IT career I want.
