  <h1><em>How AI Is Changing My Life as an IT Student</em></h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      When I first heard about AI tools being used by students, I thought they were only for shortcuts or “easy answers.”
      But as I continued my journey as an IT student, I realized that AI is more than just a trend.
      It slowly became part of my daily academic life, helping me understand lessons, manage tasks, and survive the pressure that comes with learning technology.
    </p>

  <h2>The Tools I Use Almost Every Day</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      In school, I rely on different tools to get things done efficiently.
      Canva helps me create presentations that look clean and organized without spending too much time on design.
      Google Docs and Microsoft Word are my go-to tools for writing reports and collaborating on group work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to learning and understanding topics, I use platforms like YouTube and online coding compilers such as Programiz.
      These tools help me see actual examples instead of just reading theory.
      I also use Canvas to keep track of announcements, deadlines, and submissions, which helps me stay organized.
    </p>

  <h2>How AI Helps Me Learn, Not Just Finish Tasks</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      AI tools, including ChatGPT and other AI platforms, have helped me a lot when I don’t fully understand a topic.
      Instead of just giving answers, I use AI to explain concepts in simpler terms, especially when lessons feel overwhelming.
      Sometimes, I even ask AI to explain topics in a different way until it finally makes sense to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also use AI outside of school, whether it’s to figure something out, satisfy curiosity, or understand random topics.
      For me, AI is a tool for learning rather than a replacement for effort.
    </p>

  <h2>The Challenge of Coding Without Help</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      One of the hardest moments I experienced as an IT student was during coding challenges in our past semester.
      These challenges felt like quizzes where we had to write actual Java code under time pressure, without any outside help.
      No Google, no AI, just pure memory and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time, memorizing syntax was really difficult for me.
      I knew the logic, but forgetting small details made everything harder.
      Looking back now, the code we wrote was actually simple, but because it was my first experience, it felt overwhelming.
      Today, those same problems feel much easier to solve.
    </p>

  <h2>Conclusion / Reflection</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      AI has changed how I experience life as an IT student.
      It helps me learn, understand difficult topics, and manage my academic workload better.
      However, my experiences also taught me that relying on memory and practice is still important, especially in coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      My biggest realization is that AI should be used as a support tool, not a shortcut.
      When used properly, it helps me grow instead of making me lazy.
      As I continue my IT journey, I want to balance using AI wisely while still strengthening my own skills and understanding.
