  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      After long days of classes and commuting, I often feel both physically and mentally exhausted. Traveling for more than an hour because of traffic and a packed schedule can really drain my energy. Because of this, I needed something that could help me relax and reset my mind. For me, that something is gaming. What started as simple entertainment slowly became a way for me to unwind and survive the stress of everyday student life.

  <h2>Gaming as a Way to Unwind</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      When I finally get home after a long day, gaming helps me relax. I usually play Mobile Legends with my friends, which makes gaming more fun because it allows me to bond and laugh with them. At the same time, I also enjoy low-stress games like Genshin Impact, especially when I just want to relax and not feel pressured. These games help me forget about deadlines and responsibilities, even for a short moment.
    </p>

  <p>Gaming helps me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Release stress after long school days</li>
    <li>Bond with friends through multiplayer games</li>
    <li>Relax without feeling pressured</li>
    <li>Regain focus and motivation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Balancing Gaming, Cycling, and Responsibilities</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Aside from gaming, cycling also helps clear my mind. Seeing good views while biking allows me to forget everything else for a moment. Unfortunately, because of my busy schedule and constant fatigue from commuting, I don’t get to bike as much as I want. Time management has always been challenging for me, especially since I’m more active at night and consider myself a night owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, I’ve learned that gaming and cycling are not distractions. They are ways for me to recharge. As long as I manage my time properly and finish my responsibilities first, these activities help me stay mentally healthy instead of holding me back.
    </p>

  <h2>Conclusion / Reflection</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Gaming has become more than just a hobby for me, it’s a way to relax, cope with stress, and stay motivated. Along with cycling, it reminds me that resting is important, especially after long and exhausting days. My biggest realization is that taking breaks does not mean being lazy. It means taking care of myself so I can continue moving forward. As I continue my journey as a student, I want to improve my time management and keep a healthy balance between responsibility and rest.
